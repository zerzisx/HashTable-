# HashTable-
Hashtable++ is a C++ hash table implementation with thread-safe operations. It supports insertion, removal, and lookup of key-value pairs using quadratic probing. The table auto-resizes on high load. Includes FNV-1a, Murmur3, and CityHash functions. Efficient for data storage and retrieval.
